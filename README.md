    - For my Computer Science A Level I wrote a complete web application with a backend written in Python and a frontend using the Bootstrap web framework.
    - Data was received via The Things Network over LoRaWAN from Arduinos with temperature and humidity sensors, this data was recorded into a database which could then be displayed in graphs in the frontend.
