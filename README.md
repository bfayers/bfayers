### Hi 👋

- Some of my projects:
  - Computer Science A Level Project - Environment Monitoring
    - For my Computer Science A Level I wrote a complete web application with a backend written in Python and a frontend using the Bootstrap web framework and jQuery to interact with my REST api.
    - Data was received via The Things Network over LoRaWAN from Arduinos with temperature and humidity sensors, this data was recorded into a database which could then be displayed in graphs in the frontend.
    - More information can be found [here](https://github.com/bfayers/bfayers/blob/master/csproject.md)
  - [datahub-python](https://github.com/bfayers/datahub-python) Is a python library for interacting with the MetOffice [DataHub](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint/notifications/weather-datahub) service, which will repalce the old DataPoint service.
  - [pytivo](https://github.com/bfayers/pytivo) Is a python library for controlling TiVo devices.
  - [cex-stock-checker](https://github.com/bfayers/cex-stock-checker) Is a python script I wrote to notify stock of items at CeX via Pushbullet.
