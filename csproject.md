### A Level Computer Science Project - Environment Monitoring

## Backend
The backend of my project was created in Python using the Flask library. 

My Process for creating the backend started with creating the structure for the SQL database to store data from the sensors and user accounts 
and then creating a REST API which the frontend and The Things Network could integrate with to upload and view data with.

## Frontend
The frontend of my project was created using templating provided by Flask in order to create some parts once and integrate it into multiple pages.

I used the Bootstrap framework in order to design the pages as well as using jQuery to interface with the API as well as using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to create the graphs to show the temperature and humidity data.
